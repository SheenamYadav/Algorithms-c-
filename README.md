Semseter 3 Algorithm problems
Following are the problems listed -


Q.1: Given order of n matrices, find the minimum multiplication operations required
for multiplying n matrices.
Q.2: From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other
vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm and bellman’s ford algorithm.
Q.3: Implement N Queen's problem using Back Tracking.
Q.4: Suppose you are managing the construction of billboards on the university road,
a heavily travelled stretch of road that runs west-east for M miles. The possible sites
for billboards are given by numbers , ,……… each in the interval [0,
]
(specifying their position along the roads, measured in miles from its western end). If
you place billboard at location  , you receive revenue of 
 > 0.
Regulations imposed by the Delhi road authority require that no two billboards be
within less than or equal to 5  of each other. You had like to place billboards at
a subset of the sites so as to maximize your total revenue, subject to this restriction.
Example: Suppose M=20, n=4
, , ,  = 6,7,12,14 and 
, 
, 
, 
 = 5,6,5,1
Then the optimal solution would be to place billboards at  and  for total revenue
of 10.
Give an algorithm that takes an instance of this problem as input and returns the
maximum total revenue that can be obtained from any valid subsets of sites.
Q.5: Some of your friends have gotten into the burgeoning field of time-series data
mining, in which one looks for patterns in sequences of events that occur over time.
Purchases at stock exchanges --- what's being bought --- are one source of data with a
natural ordering in time. Given a long sequence S of such events, your friends want an
efficient way to detect certain "patterns" in them --- e.g. they may want to know if the
four events
buy Yahoo, buy eBay, buy Yahoo, buy Oracle
occur in this sequence S, in order but not necessarily consecutively. They begin with a
finite collection of possible events (e.g. the possible transactions) and a sequence S of
n of these events. A given event may occur multiple times in S (e.g. Yahoo stock may
be bought many times in a single sequence S). We will say that a sequence S' is a
subsequence of S if there is a way to delete certain of the events from S so that the
remaining events, in order, are equal to the sequence S'. So for example, the sequence
of four events above is a sub-sequence of the sequence
buy Amazon, buy Yahoo, buy eBay, buy Yahoo, buy Yahoo, buy Oracle
Their goal is to be able to dream up short sequences and quickly detect whether they
are subsequences of S. So this is the problem they pose to you: Give an algorithm that
takes two sequences of events --- S' of length m and S of length n, each possibly
containing an event more than once --- and decides in time O (m + n) whether S' is a
subsequence of S.
Q.6: Suppose you’re consulting for a bank that’s concerned about fraud detection, and
they come to you with the following problem. They have a collection of n bank cards
that they’ve confiscated, suspecting them of being used in fraud. Each bank card is a
small plastic object, containing a magnetic stripe with some encrypted data, and it
corresponds to a unique account in the bank. Each account can have many bank cards
corresponding to it, and two bank cards are equivalent if they correspond to the same
account. It’s very difficult to read the account number off a bank card directly, but the
bank has a high-tech “equivalence tester” that takes two bank cards and, after
performing some computations, determines whether they are equivalent.
Their question is the following: among the collection of  cards, is there a set of more
thann/2 ofthem that are all equivalent to one another? Assume that the only feasible
operations you can do with the cards are to pick two of them and plug them in to the
equivalence tester. Show how to decide the answer to their question with only O(n log
n) invocations of the equivalence tester.
Q.7: You are consultant working for a small computation-intensive investment
company, and they have the following type of problem they want to solve over and
over. A typical instance of the problem is the following. They are doing a simulation
in which they look at n consecutive days of a given stock, at some point in the past.
Let’s number the days  = 1,2, . . . ; for each day i, they have a price "() per share
for the stock on that day (For simplicity, the price was same during each day).
Suppose during this time period, they wanted to buy 1000 shares on some day and sell
all these shares on some (later) day. They want to know: When should they have
bought and when should they have sold in order to have made as much money as
possible. (If there was no way to make money during the n days, you should report
this instead).
For example, suppose n = 3, p(1)=9, p(2)= 1, p(3)= 5. Then you should return
“Buy on day 2 and selling on day 3” means that they would have made $4 per share.
Show how to find the correct numbers  and % in time &('().
Q.8 : Your friends are starting a security company that needs to obtain licenses for n
different pieces of cryptographic software. Due to regulations, they can only obtain
these licenses at the rate of at most one per month. Each license is currently selling for
a price of $100 . However, they are all becoming more expensive according to
exponential growth curves: in particular, the cost of license j increases by a factor of

* greater than 1 each month, where 
* is a given parameter. This means that if license
% is purchased + months from now, it will cost 100. 
*(+). We will assume that all the
price growth rates are distinct; that is 
 ≠ 
* for license  ≠ %(even though they start
at the same price of $100).
The question is that: Given that the company can only buy at most one license a
month, in which order should it buy the license so that the total amount of money it
spends is as small as possible.
Give an algorithm that takes the n rates of price growth 
,
 ………
 and computes
an order in which to buy the license so that the total amount of spent is minimized.
The running time of the algorithm should be polynomial in .
Q.9: Your friend is working as a camp counselor, and he is in charge of organizing
activities for a set of junior-high-school-age campers. One of his plans is the
following mini-triathlon exercise: each contestant must swim 20 laps of a pool, then
bike 10 miles, and then run 3 miles. The plan is to send the contestants out in a
staggered fashion, via the following rule: the contestants must use the pool one at a
time. In other words, first one contestant swims the 20 laps, gets out, and starts biking.
As soon as this first person is out of the pool, a second contestant begins swimming
the 20 laps; as soon as he/she's out and starts biking, a third contestant begins
swimming... and so on.)
Each contestant has a projected swimming time (the expected time it will take him or
her to complete the 20 laps), a projected biking time (the expected time it will take
him or her to complete the 10 miles of bicycling), and a projected running time (the
time it will take him or her to complete the 3 miles of running). Your friend wants to
decide on a schedule for the triathalon: an order in which to sequence the starts of the
contestants. Let's say that the completion time of a schedule is the earliest time at
which all contestants will be finished with all three legs of the triathalon, assuming
they each spend exactly their projected swimming, biking, and running times on the
three parts. (Again, note that participants can bike and run simultaneously, but at most
one person can be in the pool at any time.) What's the best order for sending people
out, if one wants the whole competition to be over as early as possible? More
precisely, give an efficient algorithm that produces a schedule whose completion time
is as small as possible.
Q.10: (Planning a party).
Alice wants to throw a party and is deciding whom to call. She has n (which is at least
11) people to choose from and she has made up a list of which pairs of these people
know each other. She wants to invite as many people as possible subject to the
following two constraints:
1. Every person invited should know at least five other people that are invited.
2. Every person invited should not know at least five other people that are invited.
Design an efficient algorithm for maximizing the number of people she can invite.
Remember to analyze the running time and correctness.
Hint: Maximizing the number of invitees is the same as minimizing the number of
people Alice doesn’t invite. Obviously Alice might not be able to invite everyone. For
example, if one of the n people knows less than five people out of the n potential
invitees then the first constraint can never be satisfied for that person.
Q.11: Save Delhi City
Suppose you are Shaktimaan and you have decided to do something to save your
favorite city (Delhi) against the attack of Tamraj Kilvish, since no one else
surprisingly seems bothered about it, and are just suffering through various attacks by
various different creatures.
Seeing your passion, N people of Delhi decided to come forward to try their best in
saving their city. Now you have decided to strategize these N people into a formation
of AT LEAST K people in a group. Otherwise, that group won't survive.
Let's demonstrate this by an example. Let's say that there were 10 people, and each
group required at least 3 people in it for its survival. Then, the following 5 groups can
be made:
· 10 - Single group of 10 members.
· 7, 3 - Two groups. One consists of 7 members, the other one of 3 members.
· 6, 4 - Two groups. One consists of 6 members, the other one of 4 members.
· 5, 5 - Two groups. One consists of 5 members, the other one of 5 members.
· 4, 3, 3 - Three groups. One consists of 4 members, the other two of 3 members.
Given the value of N, and K - find out the number of ways you can form these groups
(anti-squads) to save Delhi city.
